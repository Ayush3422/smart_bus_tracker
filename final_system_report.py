🚀 DELHI BUS RIDERSHIP PREDICTION SYSTEM - COMPREHENSIVE TESTING SUMMARY
=======================================================================

🎯 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
==================
This comprehensive testing suite validates the Delhi Bus Ridership Prediction System
across multiple dimensions: edge cases, stress testing, and full system integration.

📊 TESTING RESULTS SUMMARY
==========================

🔬 EDGE CASE TESTING (60.0% - Grade C)
--------------------------------------
✅ Time Edge Cases:     91.7% (11/12 passed)
❌ Weather Extremes:    62.5% (5/8 passed) 
❌ Special Events:      62.5% (5/8 passed)
✅ Boundary Conditions: 100.0% (10/10 handled)
✅ Model Consistency:   100.0% (3/3 consistent)

Key Findings:
- Model handles time-based scenarios excellently
- Weather extreme scenarios need refinement
